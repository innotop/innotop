If you want to contribute a package, please contact us about it.

===== INSTALL FROM A TARBALL

If you install from the tarball, extract the tarball and go into the resulting
directory:

   tar zxvf innotop-<version>.tar.gz
   cd innotop-<version>

Generate the makefile, which will check Perl module dependencies and so forth:

   perl Makefile.PL

Install the program and man page:

   make install

To remove the files, simply run:

   make uninstall

===== BUILD AN INSTALLABLE RPM

If your system is RPM-based, you can generate an installable RPM directly from
the tarball with the following command:

   rpmbuild -tb --clean innotop-<version>.tar.gz

You can then install that RPM via your usual means (varies by distribution).

===== ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS

I have tested installation with ActivePerl 5.8.8.  Use the Perl Package Manager
tool to install Time-HiRes, DBD-mysql, Term-ANSIColor, Win32::Console::ANSI,
and Term-ReadLine.  These aren't absolutely required, but they make it much
easier to use innotop!  If your installation doesn't have it already,
Term-ReadKey and List::Util are *required* as well.  These are part of the
standard distribution unless you're running a very old version of Perl.

After that, simply unpack the zip or tarball file from Google Code and run
innotop from within a command prompt.  The only files you need are innotop.

C:\> cd Path\To\Innotop\Installation\
C:\> perl innotop
